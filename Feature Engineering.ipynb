    "# 1. What is a parameter?\n",
    "\"\"\"A parameter is a configuration variable internal to the model, whose value is estimated from the data. In machine learning, weights \n",
    "and biases in neural networks are examples of parameters learned during training.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. What is correlation?\n",
    "\"\"\"Correlation measures the statistical relationship between two variables. \n",
    "It indicates how strongly changes in one variable are associated with changes in another. Values range from -1 to +1.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# What does negative correlation mean?\n",
    "\"\"\"Negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. \n",
    "For example, if study time increases and errors decrease, there's a negative correlation between study time and errors.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n",
    "\"\"\"Machine Learning is a method where systems learn from data to make predictions or decisions. \n",
    "Main components include data, model, algorithm, training, evaluation, and prediction.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n",
    "\"\"\"Loss value measures how well the model's predictions match actual outcomes. \n",
    "A lower loss indicates better performance, guiding model tuning to improve accuracy and generalization.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
    "\"\"\"Continuous variables take numerical values within a range (e.g., age, height), \n",
    "while categorical variables represent categories or labels (e.g., gender, color) without inherent numerical meaning.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n",
    "\"\"\"Categorical variables are handled using encoding methods like One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding. \n",
    "These techniques convert categories into numerical formats that machine learning algorithms can process.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 7. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n",
    "\"\"\"Training a dataset means using it to teach the model, while testing evaluates the model’s performance on \n",
    "unseen data to ensure it generalizes well beyond training data.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",
    "\"\"\"`sklearn.preprocessing` is a module in scikit-learn that provides functions for scaling, encoding, \n",
    "and transforming input data to prepare it for machine learning models.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9. What is a Test set?\n",
    "\"\"\"A test set is a portion of the dataset used to evaluate the trained model’s performance. \n",
    "It ensures the model's predictions are accurate on unseen, real-world data.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"In Python, we use `train_test_split()` from sklearn to divide data into training and testing sets. \n",
    "This helps assess model performance on new data.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n",
    "\"\"\"Approach involves understanding the problem, collecting and preprocessing data, exploring data, \n",
    "selecting and training a model, evaluating its performance, and fine-tuning for better accuracy.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 11. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n",
    "\"\"\"EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) helps understand data patterns, detect anomalies, and gain insights. \n",
    "It informs data preprocessing, feature selection, and improves model performance.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 12. What is correlation?\n",
    "\"\"\"Correlation shows how two variables move in relation to each other. It helps identify dependencies and \n",
    "relationships important for feature selection and understanding data behavior.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 13. What does negative correlation mean?\n",
    "\"\"\"Negative correlation means one variable increases as the other decreases. \n",
    "It indicates an inverse relationship between the two variables.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 14. How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"Use `pandas.corr()` function to calculate the correlation matrix between numerical variables. \n",
    "It shows pairwise correlation coefficients in the dataset.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n",
    "\"\"\"Causation implies that one event causes another. Correlation shows association without cause. \n",
    "For example, ice cream sales and drowning deaths correlate, but higher temperatures cause both—so no causation.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n",
    "\"\"\"An optimizer adjusts model parameters to minimize loss. Examples include SGD (simple gradient descent), \n",
    "Adam (adaptive momentum), and RMSProp. Adam combines speed and stability, making it widely used.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 17. What is sklearn.linear_model?\n",
    "\"\"\"`sklearn.linear_model` provides linear models like LinearRegression, Ridge, and LogisticRegression. \n",
    "These models fit linear relationships between input features and target variables for prediction or classification.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 18. What does model.fit() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
    "\"\"\"`model.fit()` trains the model using input (X) and target (y) data. \n",
    "It finds optimal parameters for prediction. Required arguments are training features and labels: `model.fit(X_train, y_train)```\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 19. What does model.predict() do? What arguments must be given?\n",
    "\"\"\"`model.predict()` uses the trained model to make predictions on new data. \n",
    "It takes input features (X_test) as arguments and returns predicted output values.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 20. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n",
    "\"\"\"Continuous variables are numeric and measurable, like age or weight. Categorical variables represent \n",
    "groups or categories like gender or city, and often need encoding for model training.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 21. What is feature scaling? How does it help in Machine Learning?\n",
    "\"\"\"Feature scaling standardizes feature values to a common range, improving algorithm performance and convergence, \n",
    "especially in gradient-based models. Common techniques include normalization and standardization.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 22. How do we perform scaling in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"In Python, scaling is done using `StandardScaler` or `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`. \n",
    "Fit the scaler on training data and transform both training and test sets.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 23. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n",

    "\n",
    "# 24. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python?\n",
    "\"\"\"Use `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection` to divide data into training and testing subsets. \n",
    "It ensures the model is trained and validated on separate data.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# 25. Explain data encoding?\n",
    "\"\"\"Data encoding transforms categorical data into numerical format. Techniques include Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding. \n",
